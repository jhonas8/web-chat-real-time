# web-chat-real-time
  A real-time webchat made using React, NodeJs/Express and Typescript. I intend to update the project with new functionalities and bug-corrections. Also, I will review the code how much as possible, so it gets cleaner and more readable. 
  To execute it in your machine, you must clone (or download) the repository to it, then execute in both "server" and "client" directories the command "npm install". Then in the the server directory execute "npm run dev"; and in the client directory "npm start". You can also acess the project using: https://618400027cbd8e1155281c07--web-chat-real-time-react-app.netlify.app .
